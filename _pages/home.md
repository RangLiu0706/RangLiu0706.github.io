## About Me

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received the B.S. degree in Electronics Information Engineering from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2018, 
and the Ph.D. degree from School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2023. 
My Ph. D. advisor is [Prof. Ming Li](https://www.minglabdut.com/index.html). 
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar working with [Prof. Swindlehurst](https://github.com/LS-Wireless) at the Department of Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine.
My research interests focus on optimization and signal processing in wireless communication systems, with an emphasis on massive MIMO systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and integrated sensing and communications.
